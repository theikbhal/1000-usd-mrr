Day 1 of growing RedShip to $1000 MRR

Progress: $137 MRR 🟧⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️

This year, I shipped 7 different projects.

That’s a lot. And honestly, it’s also a bit frustrating.

I tried many things. Most of them didn’t really work. That’s kind of the law of indie hacking. And that’s also what makes it both hard and enjoyable. Nothing is guaranteed.

Today, I have one project that works from last year: MyFeedIn. It generates around $1,000 per month.

But it’s a Chrome extension for LinkedIn. And that’s risky. LinkedIn does everything it can to block third party tools. At any moment, it can stop working. The adventure could end overnight.

So this year, I kept shipping like crazy. Trying to build a second project I could actually live from.

Looking back, I think most of my attempts missed the mark. Wrong angles. Wrong problems. People weren’t ready to pay. And I was clearly building too much for indie hackers and builders, instead of companies.

A few weeks ago, I started RedShip.

I’ve been working on it quietly, and honestly, I think there’s something here: about Reddit marketing. This week, I onboarded my second client. A Reddit agency: €100 MRR INSTANTLY.

It might sound small. But for me, it’s huge.

Now the real challenge begins. Marketing, as always.
So I’ll focus on that, while building a tool I actually use myself to do Reddit marketing.

This feels like the beginning of a new adventure 🩷
